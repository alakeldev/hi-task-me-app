## Design

### Colour Scheme
The color palette was created by [Coolors](https://coolors.co) with the idea of providing as much contrast as possible without feeling overwhelming. Most of the colors are primarily dark, simple, and calm across the site. However, the backgrounds (body element color) were generated in one main color (dark color ‚ÄúJet‚Äù). Also, the texts have two main colors (black and white), but the title of the clear all button has a red color. Additionally, I‚Äôm using coloring shadows ‚Äúinset‚Äù with Rose and Turquoise colors inside the buttons and coloring shadows ‚Äúinset‚Äù with black color and anti-flash white as a background for the start app interface. The combination of the background color and shadow color does not overwhelm the user but gives a dark, simple, and stylish feeling. Also the main point of these colors that It does not hurt the eyes by working in a dark/night room.

### Typography
"Lora" was selected for the all application pages as this font has simple, readable and clear decoration. also I make some words looking great by manipulating the space between letters.  ("sans-serif as alt font").

### Imagery
The showing image on the start interface application was sourced from ["pinterest-website"](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/151715081184288287/).

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Start page

We are providing the user with a simple design for a start page application. The start interface is simple with a dark background color that defines the soul of the app to make the user‚Äôs eyes more comfortable. Inside this page, users have a simple design with a header, image and simple text. They can choose between two options. The first one is to start the application by clicking on the start button that has the same background color as the body page but with an inset shadow (inner) that has turquoise color. The combination of these two colors gives good UX (also as a shortcut hand, users can push the Enter key on their keyboard directly to start the application). The other option is by clicking on the close button that also has the same background color of the body page but with an inner shadow that has rose color. This action will lead to closing the application if they change their mind.

On the main page of our to-do list application, users can add new tasks using the simple and intuitive new task adding process. The first section includes an exit button for users who want to leave the app, as well as simple text to guide users on what they should do. An empty field is provided for users to enter their tasks, and below the empty field is the ‚ÄòAdd New Task‚Äô button. Users can enter their task and press the button to add it to the list.
The other section on the main page of our to-do list application is the list of tasks. Users can see all the tasks they have added and review them as needed.
