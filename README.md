## Design

### Colour Scheme
The colour palette was created by [Coolors](https://coolors.co) with the idea to provide as much contrast as possible, without feeling overwhelming. Most of the colors are primarily provided to be simple and calm across the site. However, backgrounds were generated in two main colors(calm gray and white) also the texts have two main colors (black and sky calm blue) but the paragraph text inside the landing section is having gray, while the text inside missions page is having white color. Also i'm using black shadows with white background and sometimes with calm gray backgrounds like the photos section in gallery page as an example. The combination of the background color and shadow color, does not overwhelm the user but give simple and stylish feeling. I added a feature in navigation bar elements, so when the user hovers over each nav element then the element color will change from black to calm blue, and the background of the same element will change at the same time from white to calm gray. Also simultaneously a very beatiful animation line will show above and below the same element to draw the users attention immediately to the fact that there is something there to be clicked.

![Colour Palette](assets/readme-images/website-colors.png)

### Typography
"Open Sans" was selected for the all Website pages as this font is a very famous, simple, readable and clear. also I make the some words looking great by manipulating the space between letters and by making them bold in some other places.

### Imagery
All the images on the site were sourced from free gaming stock photo platforms. The brightness, exposure, contrast and shadows of some photos in gallery section were adjusted to make it more clear and modern for displaying.

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Navigation bar
This is included across all the four pages, and provides people with an easy and animate reference to navigate between the 'Home', 'Gallery', 'Missions' & 'Contact' pages.

![Navigation bar](assets/readme-images/nav-bar.png)

#### Landing Page
It defines the soul of the website, providing the user with an animated image goes up and down, and beside this photo there are main title and text that be can easily associated to what the Website is about.

![Landing section](assets/readme-images/landing-sec.png)

The upcoming events section is listed right beneath the landing section, its title has feautre of color changing between (black, sky calm blue) to make the visitor more excited. This section is to provide visitors with full information about Call of Duty events, and to give important details such as locations, date/time, also other information in order to enable the COD players and even normal vistors to plane their attend early. Each event designed as a card with a small arrow on the bottom of the card so when the vistor hover the cursor on event's card the card will be moving a littel bit up and the arrow on the card bottom of the card will start to move untill the user take the cursor out of the card. These movings give the visitors good feeling and push them to interact with events selection by easliy clicking on Read More link if the visitors want to see more details about that event.

![Upcoming events](assets/readme-images/evetns-section.png)

#### Gallery Page
The title of gallery page is big with color changing effect and installed at the top of the page to achieve the goal of reminding the users of the page's intent.

![Gallery title](assets/readme-images/gallery-title-photo.png)

Next on this page is a Call of Duty photos with a creative decoration frame that changes its colors and shows that the page is regularly updated with newest photos. Additionally there is one small square decoration with color changing effect before the first photo and another one after the last photo. The purpose fro those two decoration is to notify the visitor in a creative way about the start and the end of the photos.

![Gallery content](assets/readme-images/gallery-content.png)

#### Missions Page
In this page we have an auto play video for the last version of Call of Duty Game, and the video was covered with a top dark layer as a decoration to make the video more elegant and mainly to make the text content above the video more clear and readable without being distracted.

![Missions content](assets/readme-images/missions-content-normal.png)

The top layer will disappear in the mobile version because the text content will be under the video not above it, and the user can watch the video and read the text below it without any distraction.

![Missions content](assets/readme-images/missions-content-mobile.png)

The background of the text section is coming in sky blue color with partially transparent and the font is white to make it easy for the user to read without any inconvenience. Also I provide a (See More) button designed as simple square with a gray background, guid the user for an external page in order to show the list of all missions.

![Text Missions](assets/readme-images/text-missions-content.png)

#### Contact Page
The title of contact page is big with color changing effect and installed at the top of the page to achieve the goal of reminding the users of the page's intent.

![Contact form title](assets/readme-images/contact-title.png)

Once again I have kept the design simple. In this page there is contact form so the visitors can reach out to Ghost team directly and write any requests or messeges. Also I provide beside the form some information about phone numbers and office location in case any visitor would like to be in touch directly with Ghost team.

![Contact form & office info](assets/readme-images/contact-content.png)

A 'thankYou' page has been also included as per the instruction of my mentor Martina who informed me about the necessisty of this page if a form was added to the project. 'thankYou' page appears as follows...

![Contact form, form dump page](assets/readme-images/dump-form.png)

#### Footer and Social Links
The Footer also has simple design and contains only links to Ghost team social media pages, where each Link will take the user to the social media platform as referred in the icon.

## Credits

### Content
- My knowledge in the practical implementation is advanced because of my bachelor degree in IT. The initial set up & style are close to my previous projects during my university studies. and also they are similar to the 'Love Running' walk-through project. From there, I took inspiration for the design of the navigation bar, landing section.... along with the display of the social links in the footer.

- My previouse experince in addition to styling the form and gallery page in 'Love Running' project were used as the starting point for my form and gallery page. However I have applied flexbox and grid properties instead of using float property as I did in love running project. this is because of flexbox and grid are more easy to control the elements on my webpage while float is complicated and¬†not¬†flexible.

- The way which I have been always following since my studies at university is to start to build html page with good structure using semantic elements and Div containers that will make me understand my webpage very well then will lead me easily to initiate the correct properties to correct targeted element.

- After finishing and completing html structure for each page, I opened the Google Chrome's Developer Tools and started to add properties there on html elements inorder to monitor the elements behaviour until I got the targeted one. After that should be copied and paste it in css file.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) This website helped me to remember some properties along with the correct values range of these properties. this website was the main support for me after I have finished the available material from Code Institute.

- Most of the difficulties that I confronted with were in Media Rules. Therefore the way which i used to overcome these difficulties is to set for each element and sometimes for each section its own Media Rules. Then testing it before I add it and later to commit it.

- I used to read previouse posts on Slack Code-Institute Channels (PP1, peer code review, my class / Padawans group). These channels and Padawans group are showing past issues that others were facing with their codes in adition to some solutions suggested by alumnis. These info and posts increase my knowledge because I like to read and search in Slack Channels even if i don't have issues with my codes. Hence this will make me know more what others were facing in their codes and in some cases I got the chance to suggest them my solution and see if it's wrong or correct.

- I want to add small note that I played some online games which made me remember all the Situations, details and values inside flexbox and Grid properties with examples. These games are: [Mastery Games](https://mastery.games/post/flexboxzombies2/), [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) and [Flex Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/). "I highly recommend these games to anyone who would like to master flexbox and grid properties".
