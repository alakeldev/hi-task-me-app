Even if you close the app, browser or even your device, you can get back to your added tasks and monitor your progress because of the local storage feature. The App structure is also well-organized and easy to navigate.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The color palette was created by [Coolors](https://coolors.co) with the idea of providing as much contrast as possible without feeling overwhelming. Most of the colors are primarily dark, simple, and calm across the site. However, the backgrounds (body element color) were generated in one main color (dark color ‚ÄúJet‚Äù). Also, the texts have two main colors (black and white), but the title of the clear all button has a red color. Additionally, I‚Äôm using coloring shadows ‚Äúinset‚Äù with Rose and Turquoise colors inside the buttons and coloring shadows ‚Äúinset‚Äù with black color and anti-flash white as a background for the start app interface. The combination of the background color and shadow color does not overwhelm the user but gives a dark, simple, and stylish feeling. Also the main point of these colors that It does not hurt the eyes by working in a dark/night room.

![Colour Palette](assets/readme-images/app-colors.png)

### Typography
"Lora" was selected for the all application pages as this font has simple, readable and clear decoration. also I make some words looking great by manipulating the space between letters.  ("sans-serif as alt font").

### Imagery
The start interface image was carefully chosen to evoke a sense of comfort and organization. It features a pen and a to-do list for the week, accompanied by a cup of coffee. This image is intended to inspire users to organize their tasks and approach them with a sense of calm and focus.

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Start page

We are providing the user with a simple design for a start page application. The start interface is simple with a dark background color that defines the soul of the app to make the user‚Äôs eyes more comfortable. Inside this page, users have a simple design with a header, image and simple text. They can choose between two options. The first one is to start the application by clicking on the start button that has the same background color as the body page but with an inset shadow (inner) that has turquoise color. The combination of these two colors gives good UX (also as a shortcut hand, users can push the Enter key on their keyboard directly to start the application). The other option is by clicking on the close button that also has the same background color of the body page but with an inner shadow that has rose color. This action will lead to closing the application if they change their mind.

![Start Page](assets/readme-images/startpage.png)


#### Main App page

On the main page of our to-do list application, users can add new tasks using the simple and intuitive new task adding process. The first section includes an exit button for users who want to leave the app, as well as simple text to guide users on what they should do. An empty field is provided for users to enter their tasks, and below the empty field is the ‚ÄòAdd New Task‚Äô button. Users can enter their task and press the button to add it to the list.
The other section on the main page of our to-do list application is the list of tasks. Users can see all the tasks they have added and review them as needed. Each task can be deleted from the list after it has been completed. Additionally, users can clear the entire list and start a new to-do list with no previous tasks displayed.

![Main App Page](assets/readme-images/mainpage.png)


#### See You Later page

When users press the exit button on the main page of our to-do list application, they are taken to a ‚ÄòSee You Later‚Äô page. This page has a simple design with a turquoise smiley face and simple text that enhances the user experience and encourages users to come back later and use the app with ease.

![See You Later Page](assets/readme-images/seeyoulater.png)

#### 404 page

This page is designed to be simple and straightforward, displaying only the application title and error type/info. Additionally, it includes a small text with a link that guides users back to the start page of the application.

![404 Page](assets/readme-images/404.png)

### Future Features
- A smart suggestions using machine learning algorithms to suggest tasks based on the user‚Äôs previous tasks and habits.
- A voice commands by adding voice commands to your app so that users can add tasks and complete them without having to type.
- An analytics features that allow users to track their productivity and see how much time they spend on different tasks.
- An Email notifications by sending Emails to remind the user about the pending tasks.

### Unfixed Bugs
- First Unfixed Bug: I am experiencing in all App pages an error on Chrome & MS-edge browsers console that I cannot resolve. I have tried adding special meta data on each header of HTML app pages and allowing all the cookies on Google Chrome but none of these solutions worked. The error does not occur at all when I use Firefox.

    ![Error Permissions Policy Header](assets/readme-images/permissions-policy-header.png)

- Second Unfixed Bug: I am experiencing an error related to Canvas 2D in all app pages on Chrome and MS-Edge browsers console. The error is showing inside the process of Lighthouse and disappears after that.

  - [HTML - cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/) .
  - [CSS - cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/) .

- Javascript: After completing the CI Material and [‚ÄòLove Maths‚Äô](https://alakeldev.github.io/love-maths-game/) walk-through project, I consulted the following websites as references:

  - [JS - cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/) .

- Canvas: I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the Canvas element and its drawing capabilities through JavaScript, including the ability to create charts and add small text within them. The following websites were instrumental in my journey:
  - [MDN Web Docs - Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) .
  - [Kirupa - Canvas](https://www.kirupa.com/canvas/index.htm) .
  - [Chartjs - Canvas](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/bar.html) .

- Local Storage & JSON: I have used the following websites as my primary sources to gain an understanding of (local storage & JavaScript Object Notation'JSON')  and how to use it in my project:

  - [MDN Web Docs - LS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) .
  - [logRocket - LS](https://blog.logrocket.com/localstorage-javascript-complete-guide/) .

  - [W3schools - JSON(stringify(), parse())](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_stringify.asp) .

- Youtube Videos: I watched the video/tutorial below for a simple to-do list app at the beginning of my project to gain an idea only:
  - [Youtube - to-do list tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRg_daFjfk&t=117s) .

- My Summarizes:  Throughout my JS study journey, I created a summary for JavaScript (Vanilla and DOM) and another one for Canvas "2D". This makes it easy for me to quickly review any information I need. If I cannot find what I am looking for in my summary, I will search for it on Google.
Currently, my summaries are a little bit messy, but I plan to sort it out once I finish studying BOM and OOP in JavaScript. I will then add it to my JS summary. You can take a look on my Summarizes through the links below:
  - [JavaScript](https://github.com/alakeldev/vanilla-dom-bom-oop-javascript-summarize-with-examples/blob/main/assets/js/script.js) .
  - [Canvas 2D](https://github.com/alakeldev/canvas-2d-summarize-with-examples/blob/main/assets/js/script.js) .

- Stack overflow: I used [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to try and fix the unfixed bugs, but the errors are still appearing as I mentioned in the unfixed bugs section.

### Acknowledgements

- I want to say thank you to my mentor Martina, who consistently gave me good advices, feedback and helped me to keep the project within the prospective guidelines.

- I would like to thank the assessor for their comments related to my previous project (PP1). They helped me avoid making the same mistakes again, except for one: my Github commit messages are still too long. I apologize for this because when I received these valuable comments, I was almost finished with (PP2). However, I will try my best throughout (PP3) to make my commit messages within 50 characters.
