## Design

### Colour Scheme
The color palette was created by [Coolors](https://coolors.co) with the idea of providing as much contrast as possible without feeling overwhelming. Most of the colors are primarily dark, simple, and calm across the site. The backgrounds (body element color) were generated in one main color (dark color ‚ÄúJet‚Äù), while the texts have two main colors (black and white). The title of the clear all button has a red color. Additionally, coloring shadows ‚Äúinset‚Äù with Rose and Turquoise colors were used inside the buttons, while coloring shadows ‚Äúinset‚Äù with black color and anti-flash white were used as a background for the start app interface. The combination of the background color and shadow color does not overwhelm the user but gives a dark, simple, and stylish feeling. The main point of these colors is that they do not hurt the eyes when working in a dark/night room.

### Typography
The font ‚ÄúLora‚Äù was selected for all application pages due to its simple, readable, and clear decoration. Additionally, some words were made to look great by manipulating the space between letters. The font ‚Äúsans-serif‚Äù was used as an alternative font.

### Imagery
The image on the start interface was carefully selected to evoke a sense of comfort and organization. It features with a pen and to-do list for the week, accompanied by a cup of coffee. The image is intended to inspire users to organize their tasks and approach them with a sense of calm and focus.

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Start page

We are providing the user with a simple design for a start page application. The start interface has a dark background color that defines the soul of the app and makes the user‚Äôs eyes more comfortable. Inside this page, users have a simple design with a header, image and simple text. They can choose between two options. The first one is to start the application by clicking on the start button that has the same background color as the body page but with an inset shadow (inner) that has turquoise color. The combination of these two colors provides good UX. As a shortcut hand, users can push the Enter key on their keyboard directly to start the application. The other option is by clicking on the close button that also has the same background color of the body page but with an inner shadow that has rose color. This action will lead to closing/exit the application if they change their mind.

![Start Page](assets/readme-images/startpage.png)


#### Main App page

On the main page of our to-do list application, users can add new tasks using the simple and intuitive new task adding process. The first section includes an exit button for users who want to leave the app, as well as simple text to guide users on what they should do. An empty field is provided for users to enter their tasks, and below the empty field is the ‚ÄòAdd New Task‚Äô button. Users can enter their task and press the button to add it to the list or push the Enter button on their keyboard.

The other section on the main page of our to-do list application is the list of tasks. Users can see all the tasks they have added and review them as needed. Each task can be deleted from the list after it has been completed. Additionally, users can clear the entire list and start a new to-do list with no previous tasks displayed.

![Main App Page](assets/readme-images/mainpage.png)


#### See You Later page

When users press the exit button on the main page of our to-do list application, they are redirected to a ‚ÄòSee You Later‚Äô page. This page has a simple and elegant design that features a turquoise smiley face and concise text that enhances the user experience and encourages users to return later and use the app with ease.

![See You Later Page](assets/readme-images/seeyoulater.png)

#### 404 page

This page is designed to be simple and straightforward, displaying only the application title and error type/info. Additionally, it includes a small text with a link that guides users back to the start page of the application. The goal is to provide users with clear and concise information about the error and help them return to the application with ease.

## Testing

### Unfixed Bugs
- First Unfixed Bug: I am experiencing an error on Chrome and MS-Edge browsers console that I cannot resolve. The error occurs on all app pages and does not occur when I use Firefox. I have tried adding special meta data on each header of HTML app pages and allowing all the cookies on Google Chrome, but none of these solutions worked.

    ![Error Permissions Policy Header](assets/readme-images/permissions-policy-header.png)

- Second Unfixed Bug: I am experiencing an error related to Canvas 2D in all app pages on Chrome and MS-Edge browsers console. The error shows inside the process of Lighthouse and disappears after that.
