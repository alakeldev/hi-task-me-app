## UX

### Site/App Purpose
Our application provides you with a comprehensive list of priorities and tasks to ensure that you don’t forget anything and can effectively plan out your tasks to accomplish them within the correct time frame.

### Site/App Goal
Our application is designed to help you stay organized and on top of your deadlines. It replaces traditional pen-and-paper to-do lists and can be used on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Our application is designed to help you stay productive by organizing everything you need to do in one place.

### Audience
Our application is designed for anyone who wants to stay organized and on top of their tasks. It can be used by students, professionals, and anyone who wants to be more productive and efficient with their time.

### Communication
Our application features a clear and simple design that allows you to add tasks and monitor your progress anytime. Even if you close the app, browser, or your device, you can easily get back to your added tasks and monitor your progress thanks to the local storage feature. The application structure is well-organized and easy to navigate, making it simple for you to manage your tasks and stay focused on your goals.

### Current User Goals
- To help the user stay organized and productive.
- To reduce user stress and anxiety by keeping track of tasks.
- To have a clear picture of what the user need to do.
- To feel more in control of the user workload and less overwhelmed.

### New User Goals
- To learn how to use the app effectively and efficiently.
- To find new ways to stay motivated and focused on their tasks.
- To discover new features and capabilities of the app that can help them be more productive.
- To customize the app to their specific needs and preferences.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The color palette was created by [Coolors](https://coolors.co) with the idea of providing as much contrast as possible without feeling overwhelming. Most of the colors are primarily dark, simple, and calm across the site. The backgrounds (body element color) were generated in one main color (dark color “Jet”), while the texts have two main colors (black and white). The title of the clear all button has a red color. Additionally, coloring shadows “inset” with Rose and Turquoise colors were used inside the buttons, while coloring shadows “inset” with black color and anti-flash white were used as a background for the start app interface. The combination of the background color and shadow color does not overwhelm the user but gives a dark, simple, and stylish feeling. The main point of these colors is that they do not hurt the eyes when working in a dark/night room.

![Colour Palette](assets/readme-images/app-colors.png)

### Typography
The font “Lora” was selected for all application pages due to its simple, readable, and clear decoration. Additionally, some words were made to look great by manipulating the space between letters. The font “sans-serif” was used as an alternative font.

### Imagery
The image on the start interface was carefully selected to evoke a sense of comfort and organization. It features with a pen and to-do list for the week, accompanied by a cup of coffee. The image is intended to inspire users to organize their tasks and approach them with a sense of calm and focus.

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Start page

We are providing the user with a simple design for a start page application. The start interface has a dark background color that defines the soul of the app and makes the user’s eyes more comfortable. Inside this page, users have a simple design with a header, image and simple text. They can choose between two options. The first one is to start the application by clicking on the start button that has the same background color as the body page but with an inset shadow (inner) that has turquoise color. The combination of these two colors provides good UX. As a shortcut hand, users can push the Enter key on their keyboard directly to start the application. The other option is by clicking on the close button that also has the same background color of the body page but with an inner shadow that has rose color. This action will lead to closing/exit the application if they change their mind

![Start Page](assets/readme-images/startpage.png)


#### Main App page

On the main page of our to-do list application, users can add new tasks using the simple and intuitive new task adding process. The first section includes an exit button for users who want to leave the app, as well as simple text to guide users on what they should do. An empty field is provided for users to enter their tasks, and below the empty field is the ‘Add New Task’ button. Users can enter their task and press the button to add it to the list or push the Enter button on their keyboard.

The other section on the main page of our to-do list application is the list of tasks. Users can see all the tasks they have added and review them as needed. Each task can be deleted from the list after it has been completed. Additionally, users can clear the entire list and start a new to-do list with no previous tasks displayed.

![Main App Page](assets/readme-images/mainpage.png)


#### See You Later page

When users press the exit button on the main page of our to-do list application, they are redirected to a ‘See You Later’ page. This page has a simple and elegant design that features a turquoise smiley face and concise text that enhances the user experience and encourages users to return later and use the app with ease.

![See You Later Page](assets/readme-images/seeyoulater.png)

#### 404 page

This page is designed to be simple and straightforward, displaying only the application title and error type/info. Additionally, it includes a small text with a link that guides users back to the start page of the application. The goal is to provide users with clear and concise information about the error and help them return to the application with ease.

![404 Page](assets/readme-images/404.png)

### Future Features
- A smart suggestions using machine learning algorithms to suggest tasks based on the user’s previous tasks and habits.
- A voice commands by adding voice commands to your app so that users can add tasks and complete them without having to type.
- An analytics features that allow users to track their productivity and see how much time they spend on different tasks.
- An Email notifications by sending Emails to remind the user about the pending tasks.

## Testing
### Manual Testing
I have shared the live link with multiple people in order to receive feedback on both functionality and design. Additionally, I have conducted multiple tests on the app myself in order to identify any errors and areas for improvement.

### Acknowledgements

- I am grateful to my mentor Martina for her valuable advice and feedback throughout the project.

- I would like to express my gratitude to the assessor for providing me with constructive feedback and comments on my previous project (PP1). Their comments have helped me to avoid repeating the same mistakes in my subsequent projects. However, I regret that I have not been able to address one of their concerns regarding the length of my Github commit messages. I apologize for this oversight as I had almost completed (PP2) when I received their valuable feedback. Nevertheless, I will make every effort throughout (PP3) to ensure that my commit messages are within 50 characters.
