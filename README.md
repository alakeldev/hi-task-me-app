## UX

### Site/App Purpose
To provide yourself with a list of your priorities in order to ensure that you don‚Äôt forget anything and are able to effectively plan out your tasks so that they are all accomplished in the correct time frame.

### Site/App Goal
To help you organize tasks and stay on top of your deadlines. It replaces pen-and-paper to-do lists and can be used from mobile devices and many desktop devices. It helps you stay productive by organizing everything you need to do in one place.

### Audience
anyone who wants to keep track of their tasks and stay organized. It can be used by students, professionals, and anyone who wants to be more productive and efficient with their time.

### Communication
Through the app/site, with a clear and simple design, you can add tasks and monitor your progress anytime. Even if you close the app, you can get back to your added tasks because of the local storage feature. The website structure is also good and clear.

### Current User Goals
- To help the user stay organized and productive.
- To reduce user stress and anxiety by keeping track of tasks.
- To have a clear picture of what the user need to do.
- To feel more in control of the user workload and less overwhelmed.

### New User Goals
- To learn how to use the app effectively and efficiently.
- To find new ways to stay motivated and focused on their tasks.
- To discover new features and capabilities of the app that can help them be more productive.
- To customize the app to their specific needs and preferences.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The color palette was created by [Coolors](https://coolors.co) with the idea of providing as much contrast as possible without feeling overwhelming. Most of the colors are primarily dark, simple, and calm across the site. However, the backgrounds (body element color) were generated in one main color (dark color ‚ÄúJet‚Äù). Also, the texts have two main colors (black and white), but the title of the clear all button has a red color. Additionally, I‚Äôm using coloring shadows ‚Äúinset‚Äù with Rose and Turquoise colors inside the button and coloring shadows ‚Äúinset‚Äù with black color and anti-flash white as a background for the start app interface. The combination of the background color and shadow color does not overwhelm the user but gives a dark, simple, and stylish feeling. It does not hurt the eyes by working in a dark room.

### Typography
"Lora" was selected for the all App pages as this font has simple, readable and clear decoration. also I make some words looking great by manipulating the space between letters.  ("sans-serif as alt font").

### Imagery
The image showing on the start page (interface) site was sourced from ["pinterest-website-photos sharing."](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/151715081184288287/).

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Start page
We are providing the user with a simple design of a start page app. The start interface/page is simple with a dark background color. It defines the soul of the website/app to make the user‚Äôs eyes more comfortable. inside this page, the users have simple design and text, so they can choose between two options, first one is to start the application by clicking on the start button (or even push the Enter button through the keyboard). The other option is by clicking on the close button to close the application if they changed their mind.
